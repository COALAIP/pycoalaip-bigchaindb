Usage
=====

To use pycoalaip-bigchaindb in a project::

    import coalaip_bigchaindb

In most cases though, you won't be using this plugin directly but with
`pycoalaip <https://github.com/bigchaindb/pycoalaip>`_. This plugin makes
itself findable to ``pycoalaip`` through the ``bigchaindb`` entry point.
